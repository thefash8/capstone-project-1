<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Nigeria and moved to the UK when I was 8 years old. From the age of 8 till 18 I attended boarding school
  in Kent and then Sussex before being accepted to attend Newcastle University to study economics following my final school 
  year examinations.>
</p>

<p> At university I played 1XV rugby for all 3 years for Newcastle who were in the best league in the country at the time and enjoyed a very sociable 
  life outside of the classroom. At the end of my 3 years I graduated with a 2.2 in my economics degree. Unfortunatley this was 
  not my goal and I felt like I underachieved and so to rectify this I decided to go back to school to study for a MSC Masters degree
  in Business Economics at City University of London, CASS Business School, one of the best business schools in the country. 
  This was one of the best student experiences I've ever had and really enjoyed my time, graduatng with a Distinction in my 
  Masters.  
</p>

<p>After my masters I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do professionally but was very eager to start working and get some real world 
  experience. I dicided to undertake a few internships to see what I liked best. First in the banking sector doing trade finance 
  at Union Bank. Then in the Tech sector working for a tech start up overseas within their R&D function. Before finding a permanent role
  at a company called Chemistry, working within their Sales function. After a successful year and a half I moved to Ebury as I wanted to be 
  back in the Finance sector. From here I joined Contic and then finally OpenFin (where I currently am) which so far has been my favourite 
  company to work for.
